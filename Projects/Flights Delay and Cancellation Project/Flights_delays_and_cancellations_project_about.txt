Application used:

Tableau

Project Description:

Create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set and tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. It should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

Data set:

Flight Delays and Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
The file to use in creating data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file.

Project objectives:

Create three visualizations. Some questions it may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:
1.	Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
2.	Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? 
3.	What causes delays?
4.	What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?
Come up with a question about the data and answer it. 
Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer
